## Stage 1 — Repository Audit & Baseline Report

### 1. Baseline Environment & Inventory
- **Runtime Environment:** Java 21, Apache Tomcat 10.1 (embedded/standalone on port 8080), MySQL 8.0 Server (running locally, database `attendance_db`).
- **File Counts:** 25 Java source files across `model`, `dao`, `servlet`, `util` packages; 6 JSP views; 1 CSS stylesheet; 1 JS client file.
- **Dependencies (`lib/`):** `jakarta.servlet-api-6.0.0.jar`, `mysql-connector-j-8.3.0.jar`.

---

### 2. Concrete Stage 1 Test Evidence

The following tests were executed against the live Tomcat instance and MySQL database without altering any existing code:

| Test Target | Execution Command / Request | Expected Spec Behavior | Actual Behavior Observed | Assessment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Tomcat Endpoints** | HTTP GET `/attendance/login`, `/teacher/dashboard`, `/student/dashboard` | 200 for login, 302 redirect for protected dashboards | Login returns 200; unauthenticated dashboards return 302 to `/login` | ✅ Baseline routing works |
| **Teacher Authentication** | POST `/attendance/login` (`teacher@attendance.com` / `teacher123`) | Authenticated session created, redirected to `/teacher/dashboard` | 302 Redirect to `/teacher/dashboard`, session established | ✅ Baseline teacher login works |
| **Student Access to Teacher Reports (Security)** | GET `/attendance/reports` with active Student session (`aarav@student.com`) | **403 Forbidden** (students must not view faculty reports) | **200 OK** — Student successfully viewed full faculty attendance report | ❌ **CRITICAL SECURITY GAP**: Missing server-side role check |
| **Student Access to QR Generator** | GET `/attendance/qr/generate?courseId=1` with Student session | **403 Forbidden** | 302 redirected to `/login` -> 200 `/student/dashboard` without explicit 403 authorization error | ⚠️ Improper authorization handling |
| **Invalid QR Token Scan** | POST `/attendance/qr/scan` with token `invalid-fake-token-999` | Rejection with error message | `{"success":false,"message":"Invalid QR Code. Please scan the current code on screen."}` | ✅ Basic validation exists |
| **Database Constraints** | MySQL `SHOW INDEX FROM attendance`, `SHOW INDEX FROM qr_sessions` | Unique indexes on `session_token` and `(student_id, qr_session_id)` | Indexes present: `unique_attendance (student_id, qr_session_id)` | ✅ Basic duplicate prevention exists in DB |

---

### 3. Identified Gaps & Architectural Analysis

#### A. Database & DBMS Gaps
1. **No Connection Pool:** `DBConnection.java` creates a brand new connection via `DriverManager.getConnection()` on every query or shares single connections without pooling. Requirement requires a pooled `DataSource` (e.g. HikariCP or Tomcat JDBC Pool).
2. **Missing Transaction Management:** Scans and session updates execute individual un-transactioned queries. Concurrent scans can cause race conditions or inconsistent counts.
3. **Missing Audit & Attempt Logging Tables:** 
   - No `attendance_audit_log` table (required: actor, server timestamp, reason, affected student/session, old/new status).
   - No `scan_attempts` table (required: IP, timestamp, token, outcome, student id).
4. **Attendance Status ENUM Limitation:** Schema currently only has `ENUM('PRESENT','ABSENT','LATE')`. Missing `OD` (On Duty) and `EXCUSED` status.
5. **No Idempotent Closure / Reopen:** No support for session reopen or idempotent closure with absent auto-marking.

#### B. OOP & Code Quality Gaps
1. **Hardcoded Credentials & Bypasses in `PasswordUtil.java`:** Contains hardcoded checks:
   `if (plainPassword.equals("teacher123") && storedHash.startsWith("$2a$10$8K1p")) return true;`
   Must be replaced with standard BCrypt or salted PBKDF2/SHA-256 without backdoors.
2. **Superficial Polymorphism:** `User` has `getDashboardPath()` and `getRoleInfo()`, but lacks meaningful domain behavior, validation rules, or service layer abstraction.
3. **No Service Layer:** Servlets communicate directly with DAOs, scattering business rules across HTTP handlers.

#### C. Authentication & Role Authorization Gaps
1. **No Servlet Security Filter:** `web.xml` defines 0 filters. There is no centralized `AuthenticationFilter` or `RoleAuthorizationFilter` enforcing role boundaries, allowing privilege leakages (e.g., student accessing `/reports`).

#### D. Live QR Security Gaps
1. **Static / Unsigned Tokens:** Tokens are simple `UUID.randomUUID().toString()` without cryptographic signatures (HMAC-SHA256) or timestamp payloads.
2. **Missing 5-second Rotation:** Currently designed around 30-second window without dynamic rotation or typed fallback code.

#### E. UI & Styling Gaps
1. **Color Scheme Violation:** Existing UI is dark-mode glassmorphism (`#0f172a`, `#1e293b`). Specification strictly mandates:
   - **70% white / light neutral surfaces**
   - **30% `#582c83` purple accents and blocks**
   - Light-first academic portal hierarchy (resembling university portals).

---

### 4. Proposed Stage Plan

- **Stage 2 — Database and OOP Foundations:**
  - Introduce pooled `DataSource` (Tomcat JDBC / HikariCP).
  - Add migrations: `attendance_audit_log`, `scan_attempts`, add `OD`/`EXCUSED` status, course schedule tables.
  - Implement Domain Services and clean OOP structure with transaction handling.
  - Add unit/integration tests for schema constraints and DAO behavior.
- **Stage 3 — Authentication, Roles, and Application Shell:**
  - Standardize password hashing (clean salt/hash without bypasses).
  - Implement `AuthFilter` and `RoleFilter` enforcing strict 403 Forbidden for mismatched roles.
  - Apply 70/30 white/`#582c83` purple portal layout and shell.
- **Stage 4 — Student Registration & Portal Experience:**
  - Student official profile, registered courses, attendance analytics, upcoming classes.
- **Stage 5 — Faculty Course & Semester Management:**
  - Roster management, planned sessions, course CRUD.
- **Stage 6 — Live QR Attendance:**
  - 5-second rotating signed HMAC tokens, projector-ready display, typed fallback, camera scanner, race-condition transaction handling.
- **Stage 7 — Manual Attendance, OD, Audit & Reports:**
  - Reasoned manual edits with append-only audit trail, session reopen/idempotent close, OD handling, CSV exports.
- **Stage 8 — Final Academic Submission Readiness:**
  - Comprehensive verification, documentation, schema diagrams, OOP-to-code mapping, 3-5 min demo script.

---

## Stage 2 — Database and OOP Foundations + Security Fixes (COMPLETED)

### Scope Implemented
1. **Security Fix 1 (Password Hashing):**
   - Completely eliminated hardcoded plaintext bypasses and fake hash prefix checks from `PasswordUtil.java`.
   - Switched to standard constant-time SHA-256 verification (`MessageDigest.isEqual`) with zero backdoors.
   - Migrated demo credentials in MySQL `users` table to legitimate SHA-256 hashes (`teacher123`, `student123`).
2. **Security Fix 2 (Faculty Reports Authorization):**
   - Added server-side role enforcement in `ReportServlet.java`. Non-teacher roles (e.g. `STUDENT`) are denied with **HTTP 403 Forbidden**.
3. **Connection Pooling:**
   - Upgraded `DBConnection.java` from unpooled `DriverManager.getConnection()` to Apache Tomcat pooled `DataSource` (`org.apache.tomcat.jdbc.pool.DataSource`) with validation queries, eviction policies, and idle connection recycling.
4. **Repeatable Migration (`database/migration_stage2.sql`):**
   - Altered `attendance.status` ENUM to include `OD` (On Duty) and `EXCUSED`.
   - Created `attendance_audit_log` table for append-only audit tracking (actor, timestamp, reason, affected student/session, old/new status).
   - Created `scan_attempts` table storing SHA-256 `token_hash` without reusable raw tokens and without unnecessary IP/device data.
   - Created `course_schedules` table for course timetables.
5. **ACID Transactions & Concurrency Protection:**
   - Implemented `recordAttendanceTransaction` in `AttendanceDao.java` utilizing explicit connection-level transactions (`setAutoCommit(false)`, `commit()`, `rollback()`).
   - Atomically records attendance and scan attempt.
   - Catches duplicate key violations (`1062`) during simultaneous scans, rolls back the transaction, and records duplicate scan attempts safely.
6. **OOP Foundations:**
   - Added `ScanAttempt`, `AttendanceAuditLog`, and `CourseSchedule` domain models.
   - Added `ScanAttemptDao`, `AttendanceAuditLogDao`, and `CourseScheduleDao`.
   - Standardized attendance percentage calculation to consistently include `OD` and `LATE` in attended sessions numerator: `(PRESENT + LATE + OD) / totalSessions * 100`.

## Stage 3 — Authentication, Roles, and Application Shell (COMPLETED)

### Scope Implemented
1. **BCrypt Password Storage & Safe Migration Path:**
   - Integrated official `org.mindrot.jbcrypt` library (`jbcrypt-0.4.jar`).
   - Replaced plain SHA-256 password hashing in [PasswordUtil.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/util/PasswordUtil.java) with standard OpenBSD Blowfish BCrypt (`$2a$10$...`) with secure random salt generation.
   - Built a safe backwards-compatible migration path: legacy SHA-256 hashes are recognized and automatically upgraded to modern BCrypt upon the user's next successful login via [LoginServlet.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/servlet/LoginServlet.java).
   - Executed repeatable migration script [database/migration_stage3_bcrypt.sql](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/database/migration_stage3_bcrypt.sql), upgrading all demo accounts (`teacher@attendance.com`, `aarav@student.com`, etc.) to standard BCrypt hashes.
2. **Centralized Server-Side Security Filter:**
   - Implemented [SecurityFilter.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/filter/SecurityFilter.java) registered across `/*` in [web.xml](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml).
   - Enforces authentication boundaries: all unauthenticated requests to protected endpoints are redirected to `/login` (or given 401 for JSON requests).
   - Enforces universal role boundaries:
     - Teacher routes (`/teacher/*`, `/qr/generate`, `/qr/active`, `/reports`) restricted to `TEACHER` and `ADMIN`.
     - Student routes (`/student/*`, `/qr/scan`) restricted to `STUDENT`.
     - Admin routes (`/admin/*`) restricted to `ADMIN`.
     - Unauthorized role attempts receive a clear **HTTP 403 Forbidden** error page (never silent redirects).
3. **Application Shell & Design System:**
   - Redesigned [style.css](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/webapp/css/style.css) adhering strictly to the collegiate portal hierarchy:
     - **~70% White and light neutral surfaces** (`#ffffff`, `#f8fafc`, `#f1f5f9`).
     - **~30% Deep purple accents and blocks** (`#582c83`, `#431f66`, `#733da9`).
     - Replaced harsh red accents with royal purple badges, indicators, and radar dots.
     - Dark slate typography (`#0f172a`, `#334155`) ensuring crystal-clear readability, WCAG-compliant contrast, and professional appearance.

   - Implemented dynamic available courses catalogue listing offered courses not yet enrolled.
4. **Upcoming Classes Timetable ([CourseScheduleDao.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/dao/CourseScheduleDao.java)):**
   - Seeded weekly course timetables in [database/migration_stage4_schedules.sql](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/database/migration_stage4_schedules.sql).
   - Implemented `findUpcomingClassesForStudent(studentId)` displaying Day of Week, Lecture Time Window, Course Title, Room/Hall, and Instructor.

---

## Stage 5 — Faculty Course and Semester Management (COMPLETED)

### Scope Implemented
1. **Faculty-Owned Course Management (CRUD):**
   - **Create:** Added course creation via `/teacher/courses/create` with server-side validation on course code, course name, semester, and department. The creating faculty member is automatically assigned as `teacher_id`.
   - **Read:** Faculty dashboard displays all courses owned by the authenticated teacher, including course codes, departments, semesters, active session count, and student roster counts.
   - **Update:** Added course editing via `/teacher/courses/edit` with server-side ownership checks (`course.getTeacherId() == teacher.getTeacherId()`). If an unauthorized faculty member attempts to update another instructor's course, the server rejects it with **HTTP 403 Forbidden**.
   - **Delete:** Added course removal via `/teacher/courses/delete` with server-side ownership validation (`HTTP 403 Forbidden` if not owner).
2. **Faculty-Owned Course Rosters ([course-roster.jsp](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/course-roster.jsp)):**
   - Dedicated course roster view accessible at `/teacher/courses/roster?courseId=...`.
   - Displays all registered students for the course with Full Name, Roll Number, Email, Department, Current Semester, and course-specific Attendance Percentage.
   - Strict server-side ownership enforcement: Teachers can only view rosters for courses they own; cross-faculty roster requests are immediately blocked with **HTTP 403 Forbidden**.
3. **Semester Schedules & Planned Sessions CRUD ([CourseScheduleDao.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/dao/CourseScheduleDao.java)):**
   - Added schedule management on the faculty dashboard allowing instructors to define weekly lecture timeslots (Day of Week, Start Time, End Time, Room/Hall).
   - Creation via `/teacher/schedules/create` and deletion via `/teacher/schedules/delete`.
4. **Server-Side Validation & Edge Cases:**
   - **Time Inversion Prevention:** Rigorous server-side edge-case validation ensuring `startTime.before(endTime)`. Requests where `startTime >= endTime` are strictly rejected with an explicit validation error redirect.
   - **Ownership on Schedules:** When creating or deleting a schedule, the server verifies that the course is owned by the session teacher before executing any DB mutations.
   - **Student Access Denial:** Centralized and servlet-level role checks prevent students from invoking any faculty course or schedule endpoints (`HTTP 403 Forbidden`).

### Concrete Stage 5 Test Evidence

| **4. Cross-Faculty Roster View Blocked** | Teacher 1 GETs `/teacher/courses/roster?courseId=3` (Teacher 2's course) | **HTTP 403 Forbidden** (cannot view other faculty's student roster) | **HTTP 403 Forbidden** | ✅ PASS |
| **5. Owned Course Roster View** | Teacher 1 GETs `/teacher/courses/roster?courseId=1` (owned course) | **HTTP 200 OK** with enrolled students list and attendance stats | **HTTP 200 OK**; student list verified | ✅ PASS |
| **6. Semester Schedule CRUD & Time Validation** | Attempt schedule with `startTime=14:00` & `endTime=13:00`; create valid `10:00-11:30` schedule; delete schedule | Inverted timeslot rejected with validation error; valid timeslot persisted and deleted | Inverted timeslot rejected (`Start+time+must+be+earlier...`); valid schedule created & deleted | ✅ PASS |
| **7. Student Access Blocked** | Student (`aarav@student.com`) GET `/teacher/courses/roster` & POST `/teacher/courses/create` | **HTTP 403 Forbidden** across all faculty management routes | **HTTP 403 Forbidden** on all attempted routes | ✅ PASS |

## Stage 6 — Live QR Attendance Flow & Security (COMPLETED)

### Scope Implemented
1. **Server-Signed, Short-Lived Tokens ([QrCodeUtil.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/util/QrCodeUtil.java)):**
   - Implemented cryptographic **HMAC-SHA256** token signing using server-side secret key.
   - Encodes `sessionId.courseId.timestampMs.nonce.hmacSignatureHex`.
   - Strict constant-time cryptographic comparison (`MessageDigest.isEqual`) preventing timing attacks.
   - Dynamic 5-second rotation window with a 7-second total lifespan to account for realistic network transmission latency.
2. **Dynamic 5-Second QR Rotation Flow ([QrGenerateServlet.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/servlet/QrGenerateServlet.java) & [qr-scanner.js](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/webapp/js/qr-scanner.js)):**
   - Faculty projector display rotates dynamic QR codes and typed fallback tokens every 5 seconds via asynchronous client polling (`/qr/active?courseId=...&format=json`).
   - Live visual countdown timer (5s, 4s, 3s, 2s, 1s, 0s) transitions to alert badge when nearing expiration.
   - Live attendee counter updates in real-time as students scan.
3. **Typed Fallback Code Validation ([QrScanServlet.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/servlet/QrScanServlet.java) & [qr-display.jsp](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/qr-display.jsp)):**
   - Projector screen renders the active server-signed token code in a prominent fallback box with a 1-click "Copy Token" tool.
   - Student camera scanner and portal provide an accessible manual input field that submits the exact same token string to `/qr/scan`.
   - Verified that the server executes identical signature, validity, and database validation whether scanned by camera or entered manually.
4. **Comprehensive Server-Side Security Checks:**
   - **Signature Verification:** Tampered or forged signatures are rejected (`INVALID`).
   - **Expiration Check:** Tokens older than the 7-second validity window are rejected (`EXPIRED`).
   - **Replay Detection:** Tokens already consumed by prior scans or rotated out on the active server session are rejected (`REPLAYED`).
   - **Duplicate Scan Prevention:** Students already recorded for the active session are rejected (`DUPLICATE`).
   - **Course Match & Enrollment:** Students not officially enrolled in the course are rejected (`WRONG_COURSE`).
   - **Closed Session Check:** Scans targeting ended sessions are rejected (`CLOSED_SESSION`).
   - All outcomes are auditable and recorded in `scan_attempts` storing token SHA-256 hashes without raw secrets.
5. **Session Closure & Absentee Marking ([QrSessionDao.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/dao/QrSessionDao.java) & [AttendanceDao.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/dao/AttendanceDao.java)):**
   - Added manual session closure endpoint (`/qr/close?sessionId=...`) and auto-close mechanism for expired session windows.
   - Upon session closure, all students enrolled in the course who did not scan/attend are automatically marked as **`ABSENT`** in a single atomic SQL operation using `NOT EXISTS` to maintain idempotent reconciliation.
6. **ACID Transaction & Concurrency Integrity:**
   - Attendance recording wrapped in explicit connection transactions (`setAutoCommit(false)`, `commit()`, `rollback()`).
   - Concurrent scans by distinct students commit safely.
   - Duplicate concurrent scans by the same student are caught by MySQL unique constraint `unique_attendance` (1062) and rolled back without data corruption.

1. **Session Reopen and Reclose Lifecycle ([QrGenerateServlet.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/servlet/QrGenerateServlet.java) & [QrSessionDao.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/dao/QrSessionDao.java)):**
   - Added `/qr/reopen` endpoint with faculty ownership authorization.
   - `reopenSession(sessionId)` sets `is_active = TRUE`, `closed_at = NULL`, and extends `expires_at` by 30 minutes.
   - `closeSession(sessionId)` sets `is_active = FALSE`, `closed_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, and runs absentee reconciliation.
   - Verified that reopening allows further scans and reasoned manual edits, and re-closing safely marks any remaining absentees.

2. **Reasoned Manual Status Corrections ([AttendanceManualServlet.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/servlet/AttendanceManualServlet.java)):**
   - Implemented dedicated servlet at `/teacher/attendance/update` and `/teacher/attendance/create`.
   - Supports 5 distinct domain statuses: `PRESENT`, `ABSENT`, `LATE`, `OD` (On-Duty), `EXCUSED` (Medical/Leave).
   - Enforces mandatory audit reason: empty or short reasons (<3 characters) are rejected with HTTP 400 Bad Request.
   - Invalid status values are rejected with HTTP 400 Bad Request.

3. **Immutable Audit Trail History ([AttendanceAuditLogDao.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/dao/AttendanceAuditLogDao.java) & [AttendanceDao.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/dao/AttendanceDao.java)):**
   - Status updates are wrapped in an ACID transaction via `updateWithAuditTransaction()`:
     - Updates the `attendance` table row.
     - Inserts an append-only row into `attendance_audit_log` capturing: `attendance_id`, `student_id`, `session_id`, `changed_by_user_id` (actor), `created_at` (server timestamp), `old_status`, `new_status`, and `reason`.
   - Guaranteed atomic consistency: if either the update or audit insert fails, the transaction rolls back cleanly.

4. **Strict Role Permissions & Faculty Course Ownership:**
   - Centralized server filter ([SecurityFilter.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/filter/SecurityFilter.java)) protects `/teacher/*`, `/qr/reopen`, `/qr/close`, and `/reports`.
   - Students attempting to access faculty routes or reports are denied with **HTTP 403 Forbidden**.
   - Faculty attempting to view reports or alter attendance for courses owned by another instructor are denied with **HTTP 403 Forbidden**.

5. **Accurate Attendance Percentage Calculations:**
   - Standardized formula implemented in `AttendanceDao.getAttendancePercentage()`:
     $$\text{Attendance \%} = \frac{\text{Attended (PRESENT + LATE + OD)}}{\text{Total Sessions} - \text{EXCUSED}} \times 100$$
   - **`OD` (On-Duty)** is counted in the attended numerator.
   - **`EXCUSED` (Medical)** is excluded from the total sessions denominator (reducing required attendance burden).
   - If effective total sessions $\le 0$, defaults safely to $100.0\%$.

6. **Idempotent Re-Closing Preserving Manual Decisions:**
   - `markUnmarkedStudentsAbsent` relies on `NOT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM attendance WHERE qr_session_id = ? AND student_id = ?)`:
     - When a session is reopened and a student is manually marked `OD`, `EXCUSED`, `PRESENT`, or `LATE`, subsequently re-closing the session **never overwrites** their status to `ABSENT`.

7. **Reports & Real-Time CSV Export ([ReportServlet.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/servlet/ReportServlet.java) & [attendance-report.jsp](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/attendance-report.jsp)):**
   - Added CSV export streaming at `/reports?courseId=X&format=csv`:
     - Sets `Content-Type: text/csv; charset=UTF-8` and `Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="attendance_report_<code>.csv"`.
     - Writes escaped CSV rows: `Attendance ID, Course Code, Roll Number, Student Name, Marked At, Status, Session ID`.
   - Updated UI with high-contrast collegiate purple aesthetic (~70% white / ~30% `#582c83`), summary stats cards, interactive edit status modal, and immutable audit history table.

8. **Carry-Forward Item — 6-Digit Numeric Fallback Code:**
   - Evaluated the UI token display: replaced the raw HMAC token string with a prominent **6-digit numeric fallback code** (e.g. `492018`) in [qr-display.jsp](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/views/qr-display.jsp).
   - Derives a synchronous 6-digit TOTP-style code using dynamic truncation in [QrCodeUtil.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/util/QrCodeUtil.java).
   - Rotates in real time every 5 seconds via [qr-scanner.js](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/webapp/js/qr-scanner.js).
   - Validated on server via [QrScanServlet.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/servlet/QrScanServlet.java) through `findByNumericFallbackCode()` with a tolerance window covering network and transmission drift.

## Stage 8 — Final Academic Submission Readiness & Comprehensive Verification (COMPLETED)

### Scope Implemented

1. **Session-Bound 6-Digit Code & Rapid Guessing / Brute-Force Rate Limiting:**
   - Evaluated the 6-digit numeric fallback code: verified that it is strictly session-bound and course-bound (`data = sessionId + ":" + courseId + ":" + step`).
   - Implemented sliding-window rate limiting in [ScanAttemptDao.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/dao/ScanAttemptDao.java) and [QrScanServlet.java](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/servlet/QrScanServlet.java):
     - Tracks failed attempts in the last 60 seconds (`countRecentFailedAttempts(studentId, 60)`).
     - If $\ge 5$ failed attempts are detected, further requests are blocked with outcome `RATE_LIMITED` and user message: *"Too many failed attempts. Rapid guessing blocked. Please wait 1 minute before trying again."*
   - Verified that a student cannot guess or use a code from a session/course they are not enrolled in.

2. **Attendance Formula Consistency Across Entire System:**
   - Standardized formula:
     $$\text{Attendance \%} = \frac{\text{Attended (PRESENT + LATE + OD)}}{\text{Total Sessions Conducted} - \text{EXCUSED}} \times 100$$
   - Verified uniform application across:
     - Core Database layer (`AttendanceDao.getAttendancePercentage()`)
     - Student Academics Portal (`StudentDashboardServlet` and `student-dashboard.jsp`)
     - Faculty Enrolled Roster (`TeacherDashboardServlet` and `course-roster.jsp`)
     - Attendance Reports and CSV Exports (`ReportServlet` and `attendance-report.jsp`)
   - Low attendance threshold ($\le 75.0\%$) triggers compliance alert badges uniformly.

3. **Accessibility & Form Usability:**
   - All interactive forms, inputs, and buttons reviewed for WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance:
     - Form labels associated via `<label for="...">` and `aria-label`.
     - Explicit input styling and monospace display for fallback codes.
     - Semantic HTML structure (`<nav>`, `<main>`, `<header>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
     - Collegiate academic color contrast (~70% white / ~30% `#582c83` royal purple).

4. **Clean Academic Submission Documentation ([README.md](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/README.md)):**
   - Updated with full architecture overview and prerequisites.
   - Comprehensive Mermaid ER diagram of MySQL 8.0 schema and Mermaid class diagram of OOP design.
   - Complete OOP principles to code mapping table.
   - Structured 3 to 5 minute live evaluator presentation and demo script.
   - Automated test execution commands.

## Stage 9: Persistent Class Meeting Session Architecture & UTC Timezone Strategy

### Architecture Refactoring & Discrepancy Fixes
1. **Separation of Class Meeting Session from Ephemeral QR Tokens:**
   - A scheduled class meeting now possesses **one persistent attendance session** (`qr_sessions` row with a 60-minute duration).
   - Ephemeral 5-second rotating cryptographic tokens (`session_token`) and 6-digit numeric fallbacks are updated directly on the existing meeting session.
   - Polling `/qr/active` **never** creates a session row, **never** auto-closes an active meeting, and **never** triggers absentee reconciliation.
   - Absentee reconciliation runs strictly when faculty clicks "End Session" (`/qr/close`) or when the meeting reaches its scheduled 60-minute end.

2. **Consistent End-to-End UTC Timezone Strategy:**
   - Configured Tomcat Connection Pool with `p.setInitSQL("SET time_zone = '+00:00'");` and UTC JDBC URL parameters (`serverTimezone=UTC&connectionTimeZone=UTC&forceConnectionTimeZoneToSession=true`).
   - Implemented [`AppContextListener`](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/listener/AppContextListener.java) and static block in [`DBConnection`](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/main/java/com/attendance/util/DBConnection.java) setting `TimeZone.setDefault(TimeZone.getTimeZone("UTC"))`.
   - All expiration and closure checks in SQL use `UTC_TIMESTAMP()` and `expires_at > UTC_TIMESTAMP()`, eliminating JVM/system timezone discrepancies.
   - Preserved automatic session closure at scheduled class end if faculty forgets to close it, while ensuring 5-second QR token expiration never closes the meeting or marks absences.

3. **Reopen & Scan Lifecycle:**
   - Reopening an expired or closed meeting session reopens the exact same meeting ID without duplicating records.
   - When a student was auto-marked `ABSENT` upon temporary closure and the faculty reopens the session, a valid scan by that student cleanly transitions their status from `ABSENT` to `PRESENT`.

4. **Meeting-Count Query & Merged Session Exclusion:**
   - Updated `AttendanceDao.getAttendancePercentage()` to query `SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT id) FROM qr_sessions WHERE course_id = ? AND session_token NOT LIKE 'MERGED_INTO_%'`.
   - Updated `QrSessionDao.findAll()` to filter out merged phantom sessions with `WHERE qs.session_token NOT LIKE 'MERGED_INTO_%'`.
   - Prevents merged sessions preserved for audit traceability from inflating meeting counts or deflating attendance percentages.

5. **Course 21 Archive-First Migration & Tested Reversal Script:**
   - **Migration Script ([`migration_stage9_course21_archive.sql`](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/database/migration_stage9_course21_archive.sql)):** Archived full snapshots of sessions 208–214 and attendance 614–620 into `archived_qr_sessions` and `archived_attendance`. Preserved session 208 as canonical, rebound attendance 615 (`PRESENT`) to session 208, deleted phantom ABSENT records 614 and 616–620, and marked sessions 209–214 as `MERGED_INTO_208:`.
   - **Rollback Script ([`rollback_stage9_course21.sql`](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/database/rollback_stage9_course21.sql)):** Corrected reversal order to delete rebound row 615 first (eliminating primary key collisions), restore all 7 attendance rows 614–620 with original columns, and restore session rows 208–214 directly from archived snapshots.
   - Tested bidirectionally: Rollback and migration verified with 100% row count and session link fidelity. Course 1 and audit logs (15 records) completely untouched.

6. **Class Meeting Verification Test Evidence ([`ClassMeetingAttendanceVerificationTest`](file:///c:/java_dbms_project/src/test/java/com/attendance/ClassMeetingAttendanceVerificationTest.java)):**
   - 10 test cases covering 10+ consecutive QR rotations, multi-student concurrent scanning on same token, multi-rotation single record invariant, single absentee reconciliation, reclose idempotency, reopen preservation, 1-row-per-meeting reporting and CSV query, meeting-based percentage calculation, scheduled end closure, and Course 21 migration invariance / merged session exclusion.
   - **Result:** 10 / 10 Passed (100%).
